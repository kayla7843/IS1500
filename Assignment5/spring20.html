                This course is an introduction to computing and programming. Its
                major goal is to introduce students to the principles of
                systematic problem solving through programming and the basic
                rules of computation.

            <p>
                Emphasizing hands-on, integrated design, our program leverages
                a state-of-the-art maker space to provide our students with an
                immersive experience into the College of Engineering community.
                Through the lens of the engineering design process, the
                program weaves engineering ethics and research into designs
                created with CAD and software development programs used by
                leading industry engineering firms.Dedicated first-year
                teaching faculty with expertise in engineering pedagogical
                research and a diverse array of engineering backgrounds, focus
                on creating and evolving teaching practices to ensure that the
                program scaffolds students in an authentic and fully integrated
                manner to excel in the rest of their academic scholarship.

            <h4>MATH2341: Differential Equations & Linear Algebra</h4>
            <p>
                Studies ordinary differential equations, their applications,
                and techniques for solving them including numerical methods,
                Laplace transforms, and linear algebra. Topics include linear
                and nonlinear first- and second-order equations and
                applications include electrical and mechanical systems, forced
                oscillation, and resonance. Topics from linear algebra, such
                as matrices, row-reduction, vector spaces, and
                eigenvalues/eigenvectors, are developed and applied to systems
                of differential equations.
